## Why I build the project this way
* Expo can manage the different android and ios devices.
* The online play will give me an opportunity to apply my backend coding skills after I finish my node.js class

## What I would do if I had more time
* CI/CD
* Automate testing.

## Available Scripts

In the root directory, you can run npm install then npx Expo Start.
